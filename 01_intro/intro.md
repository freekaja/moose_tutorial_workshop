  * Parallelizations (MPI+Threads)
  * State of the art solvers
  * Plug and Play systems


Inside MOOSE, a huge number of physics modules is available for end users to start with:

  * Chemical Reactions
  * Contract
  * Fluid Properties
  * Heat Conduction
  * Navier Strokes
  * Phase Field
  * Porous Flow
  * Tensor Mechanics


This tutorial serves to provide a quick intro to the capabilities of MOOSE from a end user perspective, and ways that scientists/engineers can quickly dive into MOOSE.
